# Sports Tracking App

# Preview

# Description
We wanted to create a application that allows users to access a chatroom based on their favorite team or favorite sport, the application allows the user to sign up if they don't have a profile or sign in if they do. Once signed in there are certain options available based on the user preference; those options are to select a chatroom that is already created, or you can create your own chat room. If you access a room that was already created you are then giving the option to create a comment in the chatroom or view previous comments that have been sent from previous users. If the user decides to create a room others can join and proceed to leave comments inside the created chatroom, these options is only available for users so you must have a profile to access these features. Users also have the availability to delete their chat rooms that they have created.
